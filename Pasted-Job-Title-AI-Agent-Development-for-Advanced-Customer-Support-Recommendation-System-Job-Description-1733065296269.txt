Job Title:
AI Agent Development for Advanced Customer Support Recommendation System

Job Description:
We are seeking an experienced AI developer to build an advanced Customer Support Intelligence and Ticket Resolution System. The system will integrate machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and backend API calls using Groq to deliver an automated, intelligent support framework.

The project involves building an end-to-end solution with clearly defined layers:

Initial Processing Layer for ticket classification and intent extraction
Resolution Layer for automated problem resolution and smart escalation
Agent Augmentation Layer for real-time agent assistance and content generation
Learning Layer for continuous system improvement and knowledge updates
You will work on developing AI agents, backend integrations, and implementing workflows as outlined below.

Project Scope & Deliverables:
1. Core AI Agents
Develop AI agents to perform specific roles:

Initial Processing Layer:

Ticket Classification Agent (TCA): Classify support tickets into categories, subcategories, and prioritize based on historical patterns.
Priority Understanding Agent (PUA): Identify ticket priority and associated SLA requirements.
Language Semantics Agent (LSA): Analyze ticket language to detect nuances.
Intent Extraction Agent (IEA): Determine the intent and route tickets accordingly.
Resolution Layer:

Knowledge Base Agent (KBA): Fetch relevant solutions from a knowledge base.
Solution Recommendation Agent (SRA): Recommend the best solutions with alternative approaches.
Automated Resolution Agent (ARA): Resolve tickets programmatically where applicable.
Escalation Strategy Agent (ESA): Handle unresolved tickets intelligently.
Agent Augmentation Layer:

Agent Assistance Agent (AAA): Provide real-time assistance to customer support agents.
Content Generation Agent (CGA): Create response templates and dynamic suggestions.
Quality Scoring Agent (QSA): Evaluate the quality of responses and solutions.
Knowledge Suggestion Agent (KSA): Suggest relevant knowledge entries for better resolutions.
Learning Layer:

Pattern Mining Agent (PMA): Recognize patterns in ticket resolutions.
Knowledge Update Agent (KUA): Continuously improve and update the knowledge base.
Effectiveness Analysis Agent (EFA): Measure the success of recommendations and resolutions.
Time Tracking Agent (TTA): Track and optimize resolution times.
2. Backend Integration
Use Groq API for model calls and backend processing.
Integrate third-party libraries like Sentence Transformers and HuggingFace Transformers for NLP tasks.
3. System Capabilities
Leverage machine learning and NLP for classification, prioritization, and understanding.
Implement deep learning models for solution matching and optimization.
Use a Knowledge Graph for storing and retrieving information.
4. Tools & Technologies
Programming: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: HuggingFace, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Sentence Transformers
Backend: Groq API integration
Databases: Knowledge graph systems, SQL/NoSQL databases
Version Control: GitHub
DevOps: Docker or Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
5. Key Deliverables:
Fully functional AI agents for all layers.
Integration with Groq API for backend operations.
Documentation of workflows, architecture, and integration steps.
Testing and validation of the system to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.
Ideal Candidate:
Proven experience with AI and NLP systems.
Hands-on expertise with backend API integrations (Groq experience preferred).
Familiarity with ticketing systems and support workflows.
Strong knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning techniques.
Excellent communication skills to provide regular updates and documentation.
Project Timeline:
The project is expected to be completed within 8-10 weeks, including system development, testing, and final deployment.

Budget:
Budget is flexible based on experience and scope, starting from $5000.

Application Requirements:
Share your portfolio or relevant projects you have worked on.
Provide details about your experience with similar AI projects.
Specify your familiarity with the Groq API or backend integration.
